# grade-helper
A simple javascript app to help me grading students' tests and activities

This application can help in correcting tests by showing a table with the possible grades of students according to the number of correct answers. Just insert the number of questions in the test, and the total score for it, and then the corresponding table will be shown. This helps as you don't have to manually or mentally calculate.
